      appeared in Wuhan, located in the central Chinese province of Hubei, at
      the end of last year. The infectious respiratory disease has since been
      declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a pandemic as it was
      spreading rapidly throughout the world. Today, more than a million cases
      have been recorded in over two hundred countries and territories. Many of
       these countries had to take drastic actions to shut their borders and
       limit free movement in the hope to fight this invisible threat.

  <p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> British Prime Minister Boris Johnson
     confidently announced during the early phase of the country’s coronavirus
     epidemic in mid-March that Britain will remain open for business. Citing a
     defiant mayor from the film Jaws who kept a seaside town open despite shark
      attacks in 2006, an old quote by Johnson is suddenly relevant as he wanted
      to pursue <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#covid-19-and-herd-immunity"> 
	      'herd immunity' </a> in a stark contrast to his European counterparts.
      While this herd immunity argument is highly controversial and the country has
      since implemented far more restrictive measures in a seeming U-turn of
      policy, there has been a <a href = "https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/301397">
				  petition </a> all along calling for such containment
      procedures.  <p>
    <p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em" >  With over 400,000 signatories,
       the petition on the UK government’s parliament website called for the UK
       to “follow suit the containment procedures of countries that have been
       greatly affected by COVID-19 such as Italy” ,“restrict unnecessary travel
       between towns and cities”, as well as to “spend money to contain the virus
        rather than wait for more causalities”. Could the signatories of this
        petition reveal any insight about who are the hundreds of thousands of
        people calling for greater restriction on movement and why have they been
        relatively more concerned than others?  <p>

        highest number of signature counts, it will be our primary area of focus.
        The capital city is incidentally also a coronavirus hotspot with over
        40% of the country’s cases being based there. With the help of the latest
        census and other official data, it is possible to delve into the
        different constituencies in London and <b>deduce</b> the characteristics of the
        Londoners wanting a curtailment of movement. Let’s explore four key trends.  <p>

      <p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> London is heavily pro-labour
        with almost 70% of constituencies electing the political party. When looking at the
         mega city’s signatures as a proportion of population, it seems to be that
         labour constituencies on average have signatures that account for 1.5% of
         its population. This is significantly higher than Conservative constituencies
          at 1% and Liberal Democrat constituencies at 0.9%.  <p>

          country’s most densely populated place, constituencies within London
           have different levels of population density. There is a fairly strong
           correlation between signatures as a proportion of population and population
           density within London constituencies. When looking specifically at the
           top and bottom five constituencies in terms of signatures as a proportion
            of population, the same trend can be seen. <p>
